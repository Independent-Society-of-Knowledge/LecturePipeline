# Neural Network Architectural Patterns

## Introduction
Neural networks represent a powerful paradigm in machine learning, enabling complex pattern recognition and predictive modeling.

## Key Architectural Components
### Neurons and Layers
- Basic building blocks of neural networks
- Different types: Input, Hidden, Output layers

### Activation Functions
1. Sigmoid
2. ReLU
3. Tanh

## Code Example: Simple Neural Network
```python
class NeuralNetwork:
    def __init__(self, layers):
        self.layers = layers
    
    def forward_propagation(self, inputs):
        # Implementation details
        pass
```
